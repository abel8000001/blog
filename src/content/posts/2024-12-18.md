It’s been a really long time since the last post, but it’s for a good cause.

I have a plan for this blog, I think from now on each time I make a new post in Instagram I’m gonna write a post as some sort of a companion. That way I’m gonna feel obligated to post in IG and make more posts for the blog.

To be honest, life has been pretty boring, I’m on college break, and I haven’t really done anything significant. I’ve played a lot of videogames, watched a lot of movies, learned a little bit of programming with C# (really fun), and I think that’s it. I was in Comic-Con with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago and it was really fun, and I’m currently waiting for some clothes to arrive, I’m stupidly anxious about it because I really want them so I can go out more and take more pictures to make more posts, that’s one of my goals for next year.

I was out with my girl watching the “alumbrados” today, it’s a beautiful show of Christmas lights on the street. Today is our 9th month anniversary and I’m really happy to be with her, I love you Ale hehe.

I think that’s pretty much it, I’m gonna post more often in future, and I can’t forget to update the thoughts page, I need to fill it with some albums I’ve had on repeat for a while. See y’all soon and merry christmas.
